Employee Management System - JDBC and Hibernate

Description:
This project demonstrates two approaches for building an Employee Management System in Java: one using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) and the other using Hibernate (an Object-Relational Mapping framework).
The repository contains both versions of the application to show how developers can interact with a MySQL database directly (JDBC) or through the Hibernate ORM.

Features:
Employee CRUD operations
Sorting by attributes (ID, Name, Age, Email, Salary)
Two versions of the application:
JDBC Version: Direct interaction with the database using SQL queries.
Hibernate Version: Simplified interaction using Hibernate ORM.
